# Anicet's Capstone Project

>  In this first capstone project, the performances was :

- Use semantic HTML tags.
- Apply best practices in HTML code.
- Use CSS selectors correctly.
- Use CSS box model.
- Use Flexbox to place elements in the page.
- Demonstrate ability to create UIs adaptable - to different screen sizes using media queries.
- Use GitHub Pages to deploy web pages.
- Apply JavaScript best practices and language - style guides in code.
- Use JavaScript to manipulate DOM elements.
- Use JavaScript events.
- Use objects to store and access data.
- Communicate technical concepts to other technical people.

  I enjoyed each step and got the chance of practicing again each lesson. I hope that you will apreciate what you will see and I stay open to every suggestion, advice or help in order to improve more and more myself.

  Happy coding !!
